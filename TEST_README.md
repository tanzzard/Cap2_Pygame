In the provided code, a basic structure for both the game implementation (FroggerGame) and the unit tests (TestFroggerGame) is established.

#### 1.Test Menu Navigation:
- It calls the show_menu() and simulates user input to navigate through the menu.
  
#### 2.Test Instruction Screen:
- It calls the show_instructions() and checks if the instructions are displayed correctly and simulates user input (like pressing Backspace) to return to the main menu.

#### 3.Test Game Over Screen:
- It simulates a game over condition, such as running out of lives.
- It Calls the show_game_over_screen() and checks if the game over message is displayed and simulates user input (like pressing 'R') to restart the game.

#### 4.Test Congratulations Screen:
- It simulates winning the game and calls show_congratulations_screen() and checks if the congratulations message is displayed.
- It simulates user input (like pressing 'R') to restart the game.

#### 5.Test Movement and Controls:
- It calls handle_input() with simulated input (e.g., arrow key presses) and checks if the frog's position changes accordingly.
- It Ensures that movement is within the game boundaries.

#### 6.Test Obstacle Interaction:
- It sets up scenarios where the frog collides with different obstacles and calls check_collisions() to ensure the expected outcomes (e.g., losing a life) occur.

#### 7.Test Riding Platforms:
- It simulates scenarios where the frog rides turtles or logs and ensures the frog's position updates correctly when riding these platforms.

#### 8.Test Jumping Mechanics:
- It simulates scenarios where the frog jumps and calls handle_input() to trigger jumping and verifies that the frog's position changes accordingly.

#### 9.Test Exit and Winning:
- It simulates reaching the exit condition and calls check_collisions() to ensure the game recognizes the victory condition.

#### 10.Test Edge Cases:
- It considers extreme scenarios (e.g., frog starting at the screen edge) and tests any boundary conditions for various game elements.

#### I Used pygame for Test Development.
#### The test cases provided in the TestFroggerGame class are placeholders. I replaced them with actual test scenarios based on my game's behavior.
